"""pygame preview panels. The ONLY module in the package that imports pygame.

SDL must be forced to a pure-software X11 window BEFORE `import pygame`, or
pygame's GLX context collides with habitat's GL and crashes with
`X Error ... X_GLXMakeCurrent BadAccess` (see hw1 root_cause_analysis). Callers
must also construct Engine BEFORE initializing the viewer window, and must never
import pygame directly — always through this module.

PERFORMANCE: `Preview` is the incremental painter hw1/load.py drives. It keeps a
copy of every panel as last painted, re-blits only the panels whose pixels
changed, and pushes only those rects to the window (display.update(rects)
instead of a full flip). Standing still outside a flicker zone only the depth
panel (per-frame depth noise) is touched; the RGB and bird's-eye panels cost a
memcmp each. Besides the CPU saved, this shrinks the damaged window area that
remote desktops (NX / VNC / RDP) must re-encode every frame. `draw()` is the
stateless full-repaint variant with the original signature.
